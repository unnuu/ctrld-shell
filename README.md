## What it does

- Downloads the latest HaGeZi blocklist folder definitions (JSON)
- **Content-aware caching:** Compares downloaded JSON against a persistent cache. If unchanged, skips all ControlD API calls entirely -- zero-cost no-op syncs
- Backs up existing folders before deletion (automatic fallback on failure)
- Deletes existing folders in your ControlD profiles (by PK)
- Recreates them with fresh rules, batched in groups of 500
- Supports multiple profiles with **different folder combinations**
- Runs on a schedule or on-demand via GitHub Actions
- **Dry-run mode** to preview changes before they go live
- **Freshness report** showing when each HaGeZi list was last updated on GitHub

---

## Quick Start (GitHub Actions)

1. **Fork or use this repo** as a template.
2. **Copy the config:**

```bash
cp config.toml.example config.toml
```

3. **Edit `config.toml`** with your ControlD profile names and desired folder mappings.

> ⚠️ **TOML Parser Note:** The built-in parser is intentionally minimal. Keep configs simple: use quoted keys, single-line or multi-line arrays, and basic strings. Avoid escaped quotes inside strings, multi-line literal strings, inline tables, or date/time types. See [TOML Parser Limitations](#toml-parser-limitations) for details.

4. **Commit `config.toml`** to the repo (do **not** put your API token in it).
5. **Add your API token** as a GitHub secret:
   - Go to **Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret**
   - Name: `CONTROLD_API_TOKEN`
   - Value: your ControlD API Write Token from controld.com/dashboard/api
6. **Run it:**
   - Go to **Actions -> Sync HaGeZi to ControlD -> Run workflow**
   - Or wait for the daily 03:00 UTC cron job

After each run, check the **Summary** tab on the workflow run page for a clean markdown table showing exactly what succeeded, what failed, and the rule counts for each profile/folder combination.

---

## Quick Start (Local / Self-hosted)

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/0x11DFE/controld-hagezi-sync.git
cd controld-hagezi-sync

# Install dependencies
# Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install curl jq
# macOS: brew install curl jq
# Termux: pkg install curl jq

# Copy and edit config
cp config.toml.example config.toml
vim config.toml # or nano, etc.

# Set your token (or add it to config.toml [settings])
export CONTROLD_API_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Run
chmod +x sync-hagezi.sh
./sync-hagezi.sh
```

---

## Discover available folders

Instead of hunting through the HaGeZi repo, let the script list everything for you:

```bash
./sync-hagezi.sh --list-hagezi
```

This prints a ready-to-paste `[folders]` block for your `config.toml`, with human-readable names and raw URLs already filled in.

---

## Configuration Reference

All behavior is driven by `config.toml`.

| Section | Key | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `[settings]` | `api_token` | ControlD API Write Token. Prefer `CONTROLD_API_TOKEN` env var. |
| `[settings]` | `dry_run` | Set to `true` to preview without changes. |
| `[settings]` | `show_freshness` | Set to `false` to skip the upstream freshness report after sync. Useful in CI to avoid GitHub\'s unauthenticated rate limit (60 req/hr). |
| `[profiles]` | `names` | Array of exact ControlD profile names to sync. |
| `[folders]` | `"Name"` | Maps a friendly folder name to its HaGeZi JSON URL. |
| `[profile_folders]` | `` | Array of folder names to sync to that profile. |

### Example: Adding a new profile

```toml
[profiles]
names = ["Tesla", "Kids", "Friends", "Adults", "Work"]

[profile_folders]
Work = ["Badware Hoster", "Most Abused TLDs"]
```

### Example: Adding a custom folder

```toml
[folders]
"My Custom List" = "https://example.com/my-folder.json"

[profile_folders]
Tesla = ["Badware Hoster", "My Custom List"]
```

### Example: Disabling freshness report for CI

```toml
[settings]
# Uncomment to skip the upstream freshness report at the end of each sync run.
# This avoids unauthenticated GitHub API calls (60 req/hr limit) — useful for CI.
# show_freshness = false
```

---

## CLI Options

```text
./sync-hagezi.sh [OPTIONS]
 --config FILE      Use a custom configuration file (default: config.toml)
 --dry-run          Preview changes without modifying ControlD
 --profile NAME     Sync only one profile
 --list-hagezi      List available HaGeZi folders (ready for config.toml)
 --last-updated     Show the last updated date for configured folders and exit
 --no-freshness     Skip the upstream freshness report at end of sync
 --no-cache         Ignore persistent cache, always download fresh lists
 -h, --help         Show help
```

### Examples

```bash
# Sync everything
./sync-hagezi.sh

# Preview changes for the "Tesla" profile
./sync-hagezi.sh --profile Tesla --dry-run

# Use a different config file
CONFIG_FILE=prod.toml ./sync-hagezi.sh

# List available HaGeZi sources
./sync-hagezi.sh --list-hagezi

# Check upstream freshness without syncing
./sync-hagezi.sh --last-updated

# Skip freshness report (CI-friendly)
./sync-hagezi.sh --no-freshness

# Force fresh download, bypass cache (debugging)
./sync-hagezi.sh --no-cache
```

## GitHub Action Inputs

When running manually via **Actions -> Run workflow**, you can specify:

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| `profile` | Sync only a specific profile (leave empty for all) |
| `dry_run` | Check the box to run in preview mode |
| `no_cache` | Check the box to force fresh download and ignore cache |

After the run completes, open the **Summary** tab on the workflow run page to see:

1. **Sync Results** — a markdown table with profile, folder, status (✅/❌), and rule count
2. **Upstream Freshness** — when each HaGeZi list was last updated on GitHub (relative time + UTC)

---

## Security Notes

- **Never commit `config.toml` if it contains your API token.**
- **Use GitHub Secrets** for the token in CI/CD.
- The script strips a leading `Bearer ` prefix from the token automatically if present.
- In GitHub Actions, the token is automatically masked via `::add-mask::` to prevent accidental exposure in logs.

---

## Requirements

- `bash` 4.3+
- `curl`
- `jq`

---

## How it works

1. Reads `config.toml` to know which profiles and folders to manage.
2. Fetches your ControlD profile list to resolve names to IDs.
3. Downloads each HaGeZi folder JSON once (cached per run).
4. **Content-aware change detection:** Compares freshly downloaded JSON against a persistent cache using `cmp -s` (POSIX byte comparison). If identical, the folder is marked unchanged and all ControlD API operations for it are skipped.
5. For each profile, **backs up existing folders** before deletion.
6. Deletes existing folders by PK, then recreates them with fresh rules.
7. Rules are inserted in batches of 500 using **jq-native JSON construction** for robust, injection-safe payloads.
8. If rule injection fails, **automatically restores the original folder from backup**.
9. Freshness timestamps are parsed with **pure jq** (`fromdateiso8601`) — identical behavior on Linux, macOS, and Termux without platform-specific `date` binaries.
10. **Memory-efficient merges:** During backup fallback, the script streams source JSON via `jq input` instead of `--slurpfile`, cutting memory usage from 3-5x to 1-2x file size.
11. **I/O-friendly API calls:** Reusable temp files in the retry loop eliminate `mktemp` churn on SD cards and slow storage.
12. In GitHub Actions, generates a **markdown summary** on the workflow run page with sync results and upstream freshness.
13. Prints a freshness report showing when each HaGeZi list was last updated on GitHub (local CLI only; Actions gets it in the Summary tab).

> **Note on caching:** GitHub raw URLs (`raw.githubusercontent.com`) do not support HTTP conditional requests (If-Modified-Since / ETag). The full payload is always downloaded. The cache saves ControlD API work, not bandwidth. For GitHub Actions, add `actions/cache` to persist the cache directory between runs.

---

## TOML Parser Limitations

The built-in parser is intentionally minimal. It handles:
- `[section]` headers
- `key = "value"` and `"Quoted Key" = "value"`
- Single-line arrays: `key = ["a", "b"]`
- Multi-line arrays
- Booleans: `true` / `false`

It does **not** support:
- Escaped quotes inside strings
- Multi-line literal strings
- Inline tables
- Date/time types

**Troubleshooting tip:** If your config parses incorrectly, simplify it. Use plain quoted strings, avoid nested quotes, and stick to single-line or simple multi-line arrays. When in doubt, run `./sync-hagezi.sh --dry-run` to validate parsing without making API calls.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Destructive sync:** Folders are deleted and recreated. An interrupted sync may leave a profile without that folder\'s rules until the next run.
- **No rule-level diff:** We don\'t compare individual rules against the existing folder. If HaGeZi\'s JSON hasn\'t changed, we still delete and recreate.
- **Bash TOML parser:** See [TOML Parser Limitations](#toml-parser-limitations) above.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] `--check-update` — skip sync if HaGeZi lists haven\'t changed (high priority) ✅ *Implemented via content cache in v1.6.2*
- [ ] Optional atomic two-phase sync (blocked by ControlD API improvements)

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| `Missing dependencies` | Install `curl` and `jq`. |
| `Profile not found by name` | Ensure the profile name in `config.toml` matches exactly (case-sensitive) in ControlD. |
| `Failed to fetch profiles (HTTP 401)` | Your API token is invalid or expired. Generate a new one from the ControlD dashboard. |
| `Batch X failed (HTTP 4xx/5xx)` | The script retries automatically with exponential backoff. If persistent, check ControlD API status. |
| `--list-hagezi shows rate limit` | GitHub unauthenticated API limit is 60/hr or 5000/hr w/ `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var. |
| `WARN: Backup has 0 rules` | ControlD API read-after-write inconsistency on newly created groups. The script logs this explicitly and flags it in the GitHub Actions summary (⚠️). The backup is harmless — the next sync will capture the rules. |
| `Cache format changed, clearing old cache` | The script auto-invalidates cache when the format changes. This is normal on first run after upgrade. |

## Development Note

This project was built in a single day using heavy AI assistance (primarily Kimi + Gemini) **on a mobile device** (Termux on Android), with full human oversight, testing, and refinement by the maintainer.

I have a strong Bash background (including previous projects like [PixelProps](https://github.com/Pixel-Props)) and understand every line of the script — the AI simply accelerated development dramatically.
